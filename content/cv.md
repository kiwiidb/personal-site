### Master in Physics and Astronomy
- From 2012 to 2017, I studied physics at Ghent University. My interests mainly lied with theoretical and computational physics.
Towards the end of my degree, my elective courses mostly pivoted to software development.


- Master's thesis: [Observational characteristics of relativistic star clusters](https://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/002/349/830/RUG01-002349830_2017_0001_AC.pdf).

    I have researched relativistic star clusters, using numerical methods and *SciPy* to solve the field equations and to calculate photon orbits.
