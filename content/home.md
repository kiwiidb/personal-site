I'm Kwinten, 26 year old freelance physicist-turned-software-engineer from Ghent, Belgium. 
Professionally I enjoy developing back-end software and infrastructure.
I'm quite good at writing things in Go and in YAML, although I have worked
with many languages, frameworks and technologies. I enjoy working with Linux
machines and automating cloud infrastructure integration and deployment. 

In my free time, I enjoy developing Lightning apps, play Warhammer Fantasy
and participate in quizzes.
