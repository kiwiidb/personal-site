I'm Kwinten, born in 1994, physicist-turned-software-engineer from Ghent, Belgium. 
Professionally I enjoy developing back-end software and infrastructure.
I'm quite good at writing things in Bash, Go and YAML, although I have worked
with many languages, frameworks and technologies. I enjoy working with managed Kubernetes, Lightning Network nodes, and automating cloud infrastructure integration and deployment. 

Check out my [Helm charts](https://github.com/flitz-be/helm-charts/).
To start browsing or developing the Lightning-native web, check out [Alby](https://getalby.com).

In my free time, I enjoy playing Magic The Gathering, bouldering and participating in pub quizzes.

Please take a look at my [CV](./cv), [projects](./portfolio) I've worked on, or my [blog](./posts).

If you'd like to hire me, please send me an [e-mail](mailto:kwinten.debacker@hotmail.com).
