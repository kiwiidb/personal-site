I'm Kwinten, born in 1994, physicist-turned-software-engineer from Ghent, Belgium. 
I enjoy building things (mostly software). I enjoy combining technologies in novel ways.
I feel most satisfied if people are then actually also happily using these things.
I have worked with many languages, frameworks and technologies. I have written a lot of services in Go,
written a lot of mobile apps in Flutter and deployed a lot of Helm charts.

My best work includes [Plowshare](https://plowshare.social), a platform for sharing Magic the Gathering commander games 
and [Nostr Wallet Connect](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/47.md), a protocol for talking to a bitcoin wallet using an e2e encrypted connection over a websocket relay.

Check out my [Helm charts](https://github.com/kiwiidb/helm-charts/).

In my free time, I enjoy playing Magic The Gathering, bouldering and participating in pub quizzes.

Please take a look at my [CV](./cv.pdf), [projects](./portfolio) I've worked on, or my [blog](./posts).
