I'm Kwinten, born in 1994, freelance physicist-turned-software-engineer from Ghent, Belgium. 
Professionally I enjoy developing back-end software and infrastructure.
I'm quite good at writing things in Bash, Go and YAML, although I have worked
with many languages, frameworks and technologies. I enjoy working with Linux
machines and automating cloud infrastructure integration and deployment. 

In my free time, I enjoy developing [Lightning](https://www.lopp.net/lightning-information.html) apps, play [Warhammer Fantasy](https://www.the-ninth-age.com) and participate in quizzes.

Please take a look at my [CV](./cv), [projects](./portfolio) I've worked on, or my [blog](./posts).

If you'd like to hire me, please send me an [e-mail](mailto:kwinten.debacker@hotmail.com).
