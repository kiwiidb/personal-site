# [Flitz](https://flitz.cards)
I made a [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network) gift card service, delivered by e-mail. The stack I am using is:

- VueJS for the front-end
- Golang for the back-end
- OpenNode for handling payments and payouts
- MongoDB for the database
- Firebase for authenticated routes and file storage
- [LNURL](https://github.com/btcontract/lnurl-rfc/blob/master/spec.md) for seamless payouts.

# Personal site

This site is made with the Hugo framework. I am hosting my pictures on AWS S3.

# Thesis

I wrote my [thesis](https://lib.ugent.be/fulltxt/RUG01/002/349/830/RUG01-002349830_2017_0001_AC.pdf) on relativistic star clusters (Dutch).
