In september 2019, I made a trip across the United States. Here you'll find some of my pictures I took during this
wonderful trip.

I departed at Brussels Airport with destination Madrid. It was an extremely beautiful day with clear skies.

In an impulsive buy I bought Snowden's *Permanent Record* at te airport. I read it during my flights on the trip.

After an initial delay of about 2 hours because of a storm in Madrid the flight departed. This meant 
I arrived in Madrid much later than anticipated.
The skies were very clear on the way to Spain and I had this magnificent view from my window-located seat when we flew over Paris.
